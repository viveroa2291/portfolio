                <p>I am from the northwest suburbs of Chicago. I grew up in Mount Prospect Illinois and graduated from Prospect High School.
                    Growing up, I participated in various sports and activities such as playing soccer, wrestling, gymnastics, and karate. <br>
                    <br>
                    I am currently on my last semester at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire.
                    Upon graduation, I plan to move to Madison Wisconsin and pursue a career within the realm of computer science as either a web developer, software engineer, or an app developer.
                    I have been programming since my senior year of high school starting off with Swift ios app developing.
                    Since that, I was pursuing a psychology degree, but made a switch to programming my second year of college. <br>
                    <br>
                    Throughout my tenure of programming, I've worked with various different programming languages such as C++, C, Java, Python, Kotlin, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                    I've worked with databases such as SQL and Google Firebase cloud storage, along with working with different frameworks and API's such as React.js and Node.js.
                    My ultimate goal is to work for Tesla or Space X and join the team in building software for one of those two companies. <br>
                    <br>
                    Aside from programming, I enjoy hanging out with friends, going to the gym, photography, and observing stocks and cryptocurrencies.

                    <p>
                        I worked at the YMCA summer 2018 as a camp counselor. 
                        I worked with kids with all different ages setting up crafts, activities, games, and going on field trips. 
                        My favorite field trip was going to an art musuem in downtown Chicago. 
                        It was a fun summer job and enjoyed being active all day and being out in the sun getting a nice tan.

                        I worked at the store AtHome from fall of 2017 until April of 2018 and worked later that winter in December 2018 through beginning of February 2019. 
                        I worked as a customer associate working freight, cashier, and stocking up inventory.
                        Occasionally, I would help do seasonal displays that we had on the floor and set up decorations. 
                        Overall, this was one of my favorite jobs as the customers and coworkers were very nice and we all worked well together.

                    <p>
                        In the summer of 2019, I worked with my friends father in construction in the Chicago land area. 
                        I would help clean out some areas, tuckpoint, and do lots of heavy lifting. 
                        It was a nice job that paid very well and had a chance to visit lots of different parts of Chicago and in downtown. 
                        Overall, I enjoyed working in it as it was hard work and I do occasionally pop in to help out sometimes when I am in town.

                    <p>
                        I worked at Amazon in the summer of 2020 and summer of 2021 as a packager, stower, and picker. 
                        I learned how to drive a pit (forklift), which was something fun to do driving around the warehouse and going up 40 ft in the air to pick up items. 
                        It was a nice job to work in during the pandemic as they provided great benefits, great schedules, paid weekly, and overtime opportunites.
                        It was a job that was a bit hard work and overwhelming, but overall I enjoyed working in.

                <p>
                    Some of the achievements throuhgout my life that I had mostly was in school and sports that I participated in. <br>
                    I've had several trophies when competing in gymnastics placing in different events. <br>
                    My favorite moment was appearing in the newspaper and being interviewed on it. <br>
                    In soccer, we got first place in a tournament where I scored a goal in a matchup where our opponents were very tough and that goal was essential for our team advancing. <br>
                    It was absolutely one of my most proudest moments. <br>
                    As for high school, I was in the honor guard, homecoming court, and prom court. <br>
                    I did not win prom king or homecoming king, but it was really nice to know that my school voted me in to be apart of that my senior year of high school. <br>
                    As of right now, I don't have much achievements that I would say I am necessarily very proud of, but I feel that would change once I graduate.
